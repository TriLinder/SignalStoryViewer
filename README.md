Then clone this repository, install the required dependencies (you'll need Node and packages installed through npm or its equivalents, and Python with flask-svelte), fill in the config file (`app/config.py`) based on the provided example file, run, hope for the best, enjoy the app and have a nice rest of your day.

Based on the [flask-svelte](https://github.com/priyanshu-shubham/flask-svelte) template by Priyanshu Shubham  - thanks!
